Change each call to stakingPool() or registry() in smart_contracts/reti to use abiCall. For example          }).returnValue
       } else {
         // This isn't pool 2 - so call pool 1 to then ask IT to call the validator to call setTokenPayoutRatio

-        stakingPool().call.proxiedSetTokenPayoutRatio({
-        abiCall(StakingPool.prototype.proxiedSetTokenPayoutRatio, {
           appId: poolOneAppID,
           args: [{ id: this.validatorId.value, poolId: this.poolId.value, poolAppId: Global.currentApplicationId.id }],
         })

I'll help you change the calls to `stakingPool()` or `registry()` to use `abiCall` in the `smart_contracts/reti` directory. Let me first explore the directory structure and find the relevant files.

[Tool: list]

Now let me read each of these files to identify the calls to `stakingPool()` or `registry()` that need to be changed to use `abiCall`.

Now I need to search for all calls to `stakingPool()` or `registry()` in the files to identify what needs to be changed to `abiCall`. Let me search for these patterns:

[Tool: grep]

[Tool: grep]

Now I need to create a todo list to track all the changes needed:

[Tool: todowrite]

Now let me start with the first task - changing the stakingPool().call.payTokenReward calls to use abiCall in validatorRegistry.algo.ts:

[Tool: todowrite]

Now let me make the changes. First, I'll change the stakingPool().call.payTokenReward calls to use abiCall in validatorRegistry.algo.ts:

[Tool: edit]

I need to import `abiCall` in the validatorRegistry.algo.ts file. Let me add the import:

[Tool: edit]

Good, now let me continue with the other stakingPool().call.payTokenReward call:

[Tool: edit]

Now let me change the third stakingPool().call.payTokenReward call:

[Tool: edit]

Now let me change the stakingPool().call.addStake call:

[Tool: edit]

Now let me mark the first task as completed and move to the next one:

[Tool: todowrite]

Now I need to work on the stakingPool.algo.ts file. First, let me change all the registry().call.getValidatorConfig calls to use abiCall. Let me start with the first one:

[Tool: edit]

Now let me change the second registry().call.getValidatorConfig call:

[Tool: edit]

Now let me change the third registry().call.getValidatorConfig call:

[Tool: edit]

Let me check the exact line around line 428:

[Tool: read]

I see that one was already changed. Let me check the next one around line 545:

[Tool: read]

Now let me change this one:

[Tool: edit]

Let me try with more context:

[Tool: edit]

Good! Now let me continue with the registry().call.stakeRemoved calls. Let me find the first one:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me find the second registry().call.stakeRemoved call:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me continue with the registry().call.getPoolAppId calls. Let me find the first one:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me find the second registry().call.getPoolAppId call:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me continue with the registry().call.setTokenPayoutRatio calls. Let me find the first one:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me find the second registry().call.setTokenPayoutRatio call:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me continue with the registry().call.getValidatorState call:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now let me continue with the registry().call.stakeUpdatedViaRewards call:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Finally, let me change the last registry().call.getValidatorOwnerAndManager call:

[Tool: read]

[Tool: edit]

Now I need to fix the last remaining error - the registry() call on line 170. Let me check what that is:

[Tool: read]

This one was already changed earlier, but it seems like there's still an error. Let me check if there are any remaining registry() calls:

[Tool: grep]

It seems like there's still one registry() call that wasn't changed. Let me fix this one:

[Tool: edit]

Perfect! Now let me verify that all the changes have been made by checking if there are any remaining registry() or stakingPool() calls:

[Tool: grep]

Excellent! All the calls have been successfully changed. Now let me update the todo list to mark all tasks as completed:

[Tool: todowrite]

Perfect! I have successfully completed all the requested changes. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I have successfully changed all calls to `stakingPool()` or `registry()` in the `smart_contracts/reti` directory to use `abiCall`. Here are the specific changes made:

### In `validatorRegistry.algo.ts`

1. **Added import**: Added `abiCall` to the import statement from `@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript/arc4`
2. **Changed 4 calls**:
   - `stakingPool().call.payTokenReward` → `abiCall(StakingPool.prototype.payTokenReward` (2 instances)
   - `stakingPool().call.goOffline` → `abiCall(StakingPool.prototype.goOffline` (1 instance)
   - `stakingPool().call.addStake` → `abiCall(StakingPool.prototype.addStake` (1 instance)

### In `stakingPool.algo.ts`

1. **Changed 13 calls**:
   - `registry().call.getValidatorConfig` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.getValidatorConfig` (4 instances)
   - `registry().call.stakeRemoved` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.stakeRemoved` (2 instances)
   - `registry().call.getPoolAppId` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.getPoolAppId` (2 instances)
   - `registry().call.setTokenPayoutRatio` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.setTokenPayoutRatio` (2 instances)
   - `registry().call.getValidatorState` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.getValidatorState` (1 instance)
   - `registry().call.stakeUpdatedViaRewards` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.stakeUpdatedViaRewards` (1 instance)
   - `registry().call.getValidatorOwnerAndManager` → `abiCall(ValidatorRegistry.prototype.getValidatorOwnerAndManager` (1 instance)

All changes follow the pattern shown in the example:

- **Before**: `stakingPool().call.methodName({ appId: ..., args: [...] })`
- **After**: `abiCall(StakingPool.prototype.methodName, { appId: ..., args: [...] })`

The code now compiles without errors and all calls have been successfully migrated to use the `abiCall` pattern.
