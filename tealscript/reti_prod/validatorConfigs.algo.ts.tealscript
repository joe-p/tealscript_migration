 * @property {ValidatorIdType} id - The sequentially assigned identifier for the validator.
 * @property {Address} owner - The account address that controls this configuration, typically a cold wallet.
 * @property {Address} manager - The account that triggers/pays for payouts and key registration transactions. This needs to be a hot wallet as the node has to sign these transactions. This property is changeable.
 * @property {uint64} nfdForInfo - Optional NFD AppID which the validator uses to describe their validator pool. This property is changeable.
 * @property {uint8} entryGatingType - Specifies an optional gating mechanism that the staker must meet. This property is changeable.
 * @property {Address} entryGatingAddress - Address for GATING_TYPE_ASSETS_CREATED_BY gating type.
 * @property {StaticArray<uint64, 4>} entryGatingAssets - Array of assets used for gating mechanisms such as GATING_TYPE_ASSET_ID, GATING_TYPE_CREATED_BY_NFD_ADDRESSES, and GATING_TYPE_SEGMENT_OF_NFD. Only the first element is used in some gating types.
 * @property {uint64} gatingAssetMinBalance - Specifies a minimum token base units amount needed of an asset owned by the specified creator. If set to 0, the default requirement is at least 1 unit.
 * @property {uint64} rewardTokenId - Optional reward token ASA id. A validator can define a token that users are awarded in addition to ALGO.
 * @property {uint64} rewardPerPayout - Defines the amount of rewardTokenId that is rewarded per epoch across all pools based on their percentage stake of the validator's total. This property is changeable.
 * @property {uint32} epochRoundLength - Number of rounds per epoch. Example: 30,857 for approximately 24 hours with 2.8 second round times.
 * @property {uint32} percentToValidator - Payout percentage expressed with four decimal places. Example: 50000 represents 5% (0.05).
 * @property {Address} validatorCommissionAddress - Account that receives the validation commission each epoch payout. This can be a zero address. This property is changeable.
 * @property {uint64} minEntryStake - Minimum stake required to enter the pool. If a staker's balance goes below this amount, they must withdraw all stakes.
 * @property {uint64} maxAlgoPerPool - Maximum stake allowed per pool. If set to 0, current system limits are applied.
 * @property {uint8} poolsPerNode - Number of pools allowed per node. A maximum of 3 is recommended.
 * @property {uint64} sunsettingOn - Timestamp when the validator is set to sunset. This property is changeable.
 * @property {ValidatorIdType} sunsettingTo - The validator id to which this validator is moving. This property is changeable.
